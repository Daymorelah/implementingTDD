This project uses the Mocha test framework and the Chai assertion library to implement Unit test
on a simple factorial function writen in javascript.
The test cases tested for are Invalid inputs and valid inputs.
The invalid inputs test for a negative number, a string input and an input value of 1.
This branch uses an ES6 version of the master while using same test framework and assertion library, i.e, Mocha and Chai
It also uses Babel to transpile the ES6 JS code to ES5.
